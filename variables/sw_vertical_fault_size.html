<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Sidewalks:</strong> Vertical Fault Size</h2>
<img alt="A sidewalk panel with a prominant vertical fault measuring approximately two inches on one side." src="variables/sw_vertical_fault_size.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>Vertical faults are points where the surface of the sidewalk is uneven, usually due to heaving or settling of panels. In order to be ADA compliant, all vertical faults must be less than ½ inch. In addition, all faults between ¼ inch and ½ inch must be beveled, or ground down to remove the fault (PROWAG R302.7.2). Larger vertical faults can create a tripping hazard and can impede mobility devices such as wheelchairs. Field staff recorded the size of the largest vertical fault in each block as well as the total number of vertical faults (included in the condition index). The compliance score for vertical faults is based on the maximum vertical fault size observed in each block of sidewalk.</p>
