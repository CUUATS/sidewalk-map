<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Curb Ramps:</strong> Ramp Running Slope</h2>
<img alt="A mid-block perpendicular ramp with a steep running slope." src="variables/cr_ramp_running_slope.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>Running slope is the slope of the curb ramp in the direction of travel. To be ADA compliant, curb ramps must have a running slope of 5.0 percent to 8.3 percent, but they are not required to exceed 15 feet in length in order to meet the maximum slope requirement
    (PROWAG R304.2.2 and R304.3.2). Blended transitions must have a maximum running slope of 5.0 percent (PROWAG R304.4.1). The running slope measurement for each ramp or blended transition was used to calculate its running slope compliance score.</p>
