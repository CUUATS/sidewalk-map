<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Curb Ramps:</strong> Gutter Counter Slope</h2>
<img alt="A ramp in which the gutter is steeply sloped from the base of the ramp to the street." src="variables/cr_gutter_running_slope.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>Counter slope is the slope on the street side of the gutter in the direction of pedestrian travel. In order to be ADA compliant, gutters adjacent to curb ramps must have a counter slope of 5.0 percent or less (PROWAG R304.5.4). Higher counter slopes indicate
    an excessive change in angle between the curb ramp and the street, creating a tipping hazard for wheelchairs and other mobility devices. Field staff recorded the slope from the base of the gutter to the street, and the counter slope measurement was
    used to calculate the gutter counter slope score.</p>
