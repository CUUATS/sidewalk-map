<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Sidewalks:</strong> Width</h2>
<img alt="A sidewalk where the passable width has been reduced significantly by overgrown grass." src="variables/sw_width.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>In order to be ADA compliant, sidewalks must have a continuous width of at least four feet (PROWAG R302.3). The PROWAG advisory group recommends a total sidewalk width of at least five feet in order to accommodate street furniture and other obstructions. Sidewalks that are narrower than four feet may be impassible to some users. Field staff recorded the narrowest passable width of the sidewalk for each block. The compliance score for each block feature is based on this minimum width measurements.</p>
