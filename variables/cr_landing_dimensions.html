<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Curb Ramps:</strong> Landing Dimensions</h2>
<img alt="A perpendicular ramp with a narrow landing at the top of the ramp." src="variables/cr_landing_dimensions.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>The landing, or flat surface adjacent to the ramp, provides pedestrians with a safe space to stop or change their direction of travel. Landings that are too small may restrict the movement of pedestrians using mobility devices. Field staff recorded the
    length and width of the landing area for each ramp. In order to be ADA complaint, both the length and width must be at least four feet (PROWAG R304.2.1, R304.3.1 and R407.6.4). The minimum landing dimension was used to calculate the compliance score.</p>
