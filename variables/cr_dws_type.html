<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Curb Ramps:</strong> Detectable Warning Surface Type</h2>
<img alt="A wide perpendicular ramp without a detectable warning surface. A pedestrian is approaching the ramp." src="variables/cr_dws_type.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>Detectable warning surfaces provide a tactile indication that a curb ramp is ending and the street is beginning. In order to be ADA compliant, ramps must include a detectable warning surface composed of truncated domes (PROWAG R305). Field staff recorded
    the type of detectable warning surface, if any, and this value was used to calculate the score for detectable warning surface type. Upper combination ramps and other ramps not adjacent to the street were given a score of 100 since they do not require
    detectable warnings.</p>
