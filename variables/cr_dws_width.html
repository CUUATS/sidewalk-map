<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Curb Ramps:</strong> Detectable Warning Surface Width</h2>
<img alt="A perpendicular ramp with noticeable gaps between the edges of the detectable warning surface and the returned curbs." src="variables/cr_dws_width.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>In order to be ADA compliant, the width of the detectable warning surface must be the same as the width of the ramp (PROWAG R305.1.4). However, PROWAG provides for a two-inch border around the detectable warning surface needed to secure some truncated
    dome panels to the ramp surface (Advisory R305.2). Detectable warning surfaces that are too narrow may be missed by pedestrians traveling along the edge of the ramp. Field staff measured the width of the detectable warning surface. Using the width
    of the ramp, the percent coverage of the detectable warning surface was calculated and was used to determine the detectable warning surface width compliance score.</p>
