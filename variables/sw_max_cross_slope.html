<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Sidewalks:</strong> Maximum Cross Slope</h2>
<img alt="A block of sidewalk in which some panels are visibly sloped to the left." src="variables/sw_max_cross_slope.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>Cross slope is the slope of the sidewalk perpendicular to the direction of travel. In order to be ADA compliant, sidewalk cross slopes must be 2.0 percent or less (PROWAG R302.6). Greater cross slopes can make wheelchairs, walkers and other mobility devices
    unstable. Field staff recorded the sidewalk cross slope every time a driveway crossed the sidewalk as well as a representative summary cross slope for each block. The score for cross slope is based on the maximum value for the block</p>
