<h2 class="variable-name"><strong>Sidewalks:</strong> Obstructions</h2>
<img alt="A brick sidewalk with significant overgrowth from grass and bushes." src="variables/sw_obstruction.jpg" class="variable-image">
<p>Obstructions are objects that impede travel on the sidewalk. In order to be ADA compliant, sidewalks must have a four-foot wide clear path free from obstructions (PROWAG R210). Sidewalks where the clear width is less than four feet may be impassible for some users. Field staff recorded the type of obstruction present, if any, for each block of sidewalk. They also recorded specific point geolocations of major obstructions. The compliance score for sidewalk obstructions is based on the number of types of obstructions present in each block.</p>
